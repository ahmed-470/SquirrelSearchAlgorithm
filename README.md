# Squirrel Search Optimization

This squirrel search optimizer imitates the dynamic foraging behaviour of southern flying squirrels and their efficient way of locomotion known as gliding. Gliding is an effective mechanism used by small mammals for travelling long distances.The search process begins when flying squirrels start foraging. During warm weather (autumn) the squirrels search for food resources by gliding from one tree to the other. While doing so, they change their location and explore different areas of forest. As the climatic conditions are hot enough, they can meet their daily energy needs more quickly on the diet of acorns available in abundance and hence they consume acorns immediately upon finding them.
